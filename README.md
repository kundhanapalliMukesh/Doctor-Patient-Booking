<h1 align="center">ü©∫ Doctor-Patient-Booking ü©∫</h1>

<p align="center">
Developed a web application for booking doctor-patient appointments.  Node.js and a preferred library or framework are used for both frontend and backend development, respectively.  Important features include setting up role-based authorization, guaranteeing secure authentication through session-based or JWT methods, and integrating Google Calendar for appointment scheduling.  Data about users and appointments will be stored in a database (such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL).  The doctor's dashboard, appointment scheduling, login, and registration must all have intuitive user interfaces on the front end.  Notifications, appointment rescheduling, and a doctor search feature are optional.The evaluation process places a strong emphasis on code readability and following best practices.  UI design is secondary to functionality.

<h2 align="center">Features</h2>

**Frontend Development:**
1. Makes use of any frontend framework or library, such as Vue.js, Angular, or React.
2. Easy-to-use interfaces for patient and physician login and registration.
3. Patient appointment scheduling forms that are easy to use and integrate with Google Calendar.
4. A dashboard that syncs with Google Calendar to help doctors manage appointments.

**Backend Development:**
1. RESTful API with Express and Node.js.
2. Pathways for managing, scheduling, and authenticating users.
3. Makes use of a selected database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
4. Google Calendar API integration for scheduling appointments.

**Authentication:**
1. A safe system of patient and physician authentication.
2. Makes use of methods such as session-based authentication or JWT.
3. Only users who have been authenticated can access.

**Authorization:**
1. Permissions based on roles (e.g., admin, patient, doctor).
2. User role-based access control.
3. Specific information can be accessed and appointments can be changed by authorized users.

**Optional Features:**
1. Reminders for appointments via email or push notifications.
2. The ability of patients to postpone or cancel appointments.
3. The ability to search for doctors by availability, location, or specialty.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
1. Appropriate RESTful API implementation and backend functionality.
2. A secure system for authentication (session-based or JWT).
3. Effective use of databases.
4. The integration of Google Calendar was successful.
5. The appropriate application of access control and authorization.
6. Input validation and error handling.
7. Features that are optional (if implemented).
8. A focus on coding standards and readable code.
9. UI design is subordinated to functionality.

<h2 align="center">Project Overview</h2>

2. **Technology Stack:**
   - Backend: Node.js and Express
   - Frontend: Any library/framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js)
   - Database: Choice of database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
   - Integration: Google Calendar API

3. **Backend Development:**
   - Develop a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.
   - Implement routes for user authentication, appointment booking, and management.
   - Store user information and appointment data in a database.
   - Integrate Google Calendar API for appointment scheduling.

4. **Frontend Development:**
   - Create user interfaces for doctor and patient registration and login.
   - Design intuitive forms for patients to book appointments.
   - Develop a doctor's dashboard for appointment management.
   - Utilize a frontend library/framework of choice.

5. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Implement a secure authentication system for doctors and patients.
